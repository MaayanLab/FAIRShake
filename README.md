# FAIRshake

A web interface for the scoring of biomedical digital objects by user evaluation according to the FAIR data principles: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.

Available at http://fairshake.cloud/

## Code Layout
- FAIRshake: The django project settings
- FAIRshakeHub: The website itself, gets all of its information from FAIRshakeAPI
- FAIRshakeAPI: The primary API facilitator, is enabled with the other API components

## Development

### Setup
Python 3 is required to run this project.

Install all dependencies into your environment.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that `mysqlclient` is the recommended client but `pymysql` can be used as a fallback.

### Django Shell
ipython is recommended: `pip install ipython`
`./manage.py shell`

### Django Live Reloading Server
In separate terminals execute these commands and then navigate to <http://localhost:8000/v2/>.
```bash
./manage.py runserver
./manage.py livereload
```

### Build Docker
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Database migrations
Django keeps track of database migrations. When modifying `models` it is imperative to create and apply migrations on all old databases. Migrations can be safely removed if they have been applied to all independent databases (for that reason, it's probably better to just notÂ remove them).
```bash
./manage.py makemigrations
./manage.py migrate
```

Note that this will try but not always succeed to detect renamed fields and such and migrate the backend database accordingly. If it is unable to, it may require manual intervention. For more information https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/migrations/.

## Production
### Secret values
For the docker-compose to work properly in production, `/ssl/` should have the following files:
- `my.cnf`: mysql configuration file with production database credentials
  - This file can be specified with `MYSQL_CONFIG` environment variable
- `secret.txt`: Secret key for production (random private string of characters)
- `cert.key`: SSL Private Key
- `cert.crt`: SSL CA Signed Public Key

### Docker deployment
```bash
docker-compose up
````
